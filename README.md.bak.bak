## Running the Project with Docker

This project provides a full Docker-based setup for local development and deployment. The stack includes three main services:

- **Back-end (NestJS, Node.js v22.13.1)**
- **Front-end (Vite, Node.js v22.13.1)**
- **Image Service (Python 3.11)**

### Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- No additional global dependencies are required.

### Service Ports
- **Back-end:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Front-end:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Image Service:** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Environment Variables
- If your back-end or front-end requires environment variables, create `.env` files in `./back-end` and/or `./front-end` as needed. See the Docker Compose file for details. By default, no `.env` files are required unless your application logic depends on them.

### Build and Run
To build and start all services, run:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

This will build and start the back-end, front-end, and image service containers, and connect them on a shared Docker network.

### Special Configuration
- All services run as non-root users for improved security.
- The back-end and front-end use Node.js version `22.13.1` (as specified in the Dockerfiles).
- The image service uses Python 3.11 and installs dependencies into a virtual environment inside the container.
- If you need to add environment variables, uncomment and edit the `env_file` lines in `compose.yaml` and provide the corresponding `.env` files.

### Service Dependencies
- The back-end depends on the image service.
- The front-end depends on the back-end.

### Stopping the Stack
To stop all services:

```sh
docker compose down
```
