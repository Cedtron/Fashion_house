## Running the Project with Docker

This project is composed of three main services: back-end (NestJS), front-end (React/Vite), and an image service (Python). Each service has its own Dockerfile and is orchestrated via Docker Compose.

### Project-Specific Docker Requirements
- **Node.js Version:** All Node-based services use `node:22.13.1-slim` (as specified in Dockerfiles).
- **Python Version:** The image service uses `python:3.11-slim`.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Node services use `npm ci` for deterministic installs.
  - Python service installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` into a virtual environment (`.venv`).

### Environment Variables
- **Front-end:** Requires a `.env` file in `./front-end` (referenced in `docker-compose.yml`).
- **Back-end:** Optionally supports a `.env` file in `./back-end` (uncomment `env_file` in `docker-compose.yml` if present).

### Build and Run Instructions
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. Place any required `.env` files in `./front-end` and (optionally) `./back-end`.
3. From the project root, build and start all services:
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This will build and start:
   - `node-back-end` (NestJS API)
   - `node-front-end` (React/Vite UI)
   - `python-image-service` (Python image API)

### Ports Exposed
- **Back-end:** `3000` (http://localhost:3000)
- **Front-end:** `5173` (http://localhost:5173)
- **Image Service:** `8000` (http://localhost:8000)

### Special Configuration
- All services run as non-root users for security (see Dockerfiles).
- The front-end service requires its `.env` file for configuration.
- The back-end service can use a `.env` file if needed; update `docker-compose.yml` to enable.
- All services are connected via a custom Docker network (`app-network`).
- The image service's `uploads/stock/` directory is included in the container (empty by default).
